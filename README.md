## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
In order to contribute to Cinny project, you may need to sign a CLA. 
You can find the [CLA document here](https://github.com/cinnyapp/cla/blob/main/cla.md).

### How to sign
Upon open the pull request to any of the project under Cinnyapp organisation, a bot
will assess whether you have signed the CLA or not, if not it will comment on pull rquest
with instruction to sign it.

### But why?
There are multiple reason for it.
1. To ensure that all the contribution are licensed under the project's respective license.
2. To be able to enforce any given project license.
3. We want to focus our energies on code rather than legal challenges.
4. To keep the door open for commercial offerings.

To clarify, We don't have a legal entity yet so for the time being the rights are given to Ajay Bura.

If you have any other question, feel free to ask.
